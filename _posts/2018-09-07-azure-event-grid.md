When I was at [That Conference](https://www.thatconference.com/){:target="_blank"} last month, I learned about a relatively new offering called [Azure Event Grids](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/videos/introducing-azure-event-grid/){:target="_blank"}.  I learned about it in an open space session.  A couple of the guys in the session had only been using it for a couple of months but showed me how it is revolutionizing how they use their Azure subscriptions.  They described it as an 'If this then that' ([IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/){:target="_blank"}) approach to Azure.

Here's a really good intro [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8ia7J4Y7tI&feature=youtu.be){:target="_blank"} on the subject.

While I have not gotten a chance to experiment with it yet, I thought I would share this information with anyone looking for a good solution to paste together events and actions within your Azure subscriptions.  I will blog more on this as I experiment and learn more about Event Grids.
