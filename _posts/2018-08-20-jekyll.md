I've started using Jekyll with github pages for blogging using markdown  (rather than using Wordpress).  It is much nicer to develop this static content in markdown and push the documentation up to git, just like code commits.

For information on how to get started using Jekyll nad Github pages, see:  [Jekyll with Github Pages link](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll)
