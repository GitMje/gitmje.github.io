I have worked with many different querying languages, such as Splunk's Search Processing Language (SPL), ElasticSearch, and Sumo Logic's search syntax language.  Of all of them, I find KQL to be much simplier to pickup and master.  

KQL is a language used by Microsoft Azure in Log Analytics and also in Application Insights for querying time-series data sets.

Here are some materials that I've found to make the learning curve much quicker:

- [Kusto to SQL translation table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/query/sqlcheatsheet){:target="_blank"}
- [Pluralsight-Kusto Query Language (KQL) from Scratch](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/kusto-query-language-kql-from-scratch){:target="_blank"}
- [Use Microsoft's example data set online to practice](https://portal.loganalytics.io/demo#/discover/query/main){:target="_blank"}
