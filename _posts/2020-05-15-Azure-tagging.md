Just a quick note ... Here is a nice article on Azure Tagging and Policy enforcement for cost control and maintenance windows.  

See [Managing Resource Tagging with Azure Policy](https://cloudskills.io/blog/azure-policy-tagging?__s=uqywoptvtgjkvewfgurh)

If you don't control your department's costs in Azure, someone else in the company will...after a costly mistake occurs.  Do it through automation, so that external teams do not put time-consuming and labor intensive manual controls in place.
