I believe in automate-all-of-the things, so I decided to automate myself.  I recently decided to buid a zoombot to use on my next work virtual happy hour via Zoom.  

<p>&nbsp;</p>

To try it out yourself:

1. Open [Michael's Zoombot](https://zoomblob.z19.web.core.windows.net/) in a Chrome Browser.
2. Press the Turn On Zoombot button in the left corner.
3. Talk to it like you would to me via a headset.


<p>&nbsp;</p>

It will reply to statements like: 

- `Hi, What's up`, 
- `Tell me a knock knock joke` , 
- `Tell me another joke`, 
- etc.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

I've heavily modified my version and will soon PR my commits back to [Zoombot](https://github.com/mcreed/zoombot).  The JavaScript is really rough, and I plan to refactor the whole thing in React.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/erpenbeck) and let me know if you think that the Zoombot is:
1. Super creepy, delete it now!
2. Mostly creepy, but also a little funny.
3. Really funny. 

I'm hoping that people find it amusing.
