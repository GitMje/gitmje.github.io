Nothing is cooler than monitoring and controlling your Cloud resources on the couch from your mobile device/tablet.  Microsoft has created a really nice mobile app for Android and iOS (iPhone, iPod, etc).  

You can download it from the App Store or Android Play Store.  It is a general purpose tool, you can use it start VMs, stop VMs, and even RDP into a VM.  

The most useful feature for me is the monitoring that you can do via App Insights and Log Analytics.  You can pin charts to your favorites panel and you can get notifications of events in the system.  It's a great time to be on the Azure Platform.
